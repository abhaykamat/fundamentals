fundamentals
============


C++ library collection of fundamental algorithms and methods commonly tested in coding and quantitative finance interviews. Emphasis is on simplicity, minimizing use of STL or Boost libs. This is largely an educational exercise with little to no practical use cases. The majority of algorithms in Fundamentals can be found in more generic and/or efficient form in STL, Boost and various other libraries.
